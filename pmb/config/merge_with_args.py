    We have the internal config (pmb/config/__init__.py) and the user config
    (usually ~/.config/pmbootstrap.cfg, can be changed with the '-c' parameter).

    Args holds the variables parsed from the commandline (e.g. -j fills out
    args.jobs), and values specified on the commandline count the most.

    In case it is not specified on the commandline, for the keys in
    pmb.config.config_keys, we look into the value set in the the user config.

    When that is empty as well (e.g. just before pmbootstrap init), or the key
    is not in pmb.config_keys, we use the default value from the internal
    config.
