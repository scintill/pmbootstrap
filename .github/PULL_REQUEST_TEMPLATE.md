<!--
    We appreciate that you are about to create a pull request (PR)!

    In order to get it tested (code change), reviewed and merged quickly,
    please take a look at the following notes.

    1. We only merge PRs that pass all tests:
        * As soon as you create the PR, automatic tests will run with Travis CI
        * Come back later to see if everything passed
        * Click on the failed test icon to see why it failed and try to fix it
        * In case Travis failed for a reason not related to your changes (e.g.
          network issues or missing documentation), push an empty commit:
            git commit --allow-empty -m 'run tests again'
        * You can run the tests locally as well:
            test/static_code_analysis.sh
            test/testcases_fast.sh
    2. All commits in the PR will get squashed into one (so you don't need to
       do that).
    3. New device:
        * Is it documented in the wiki?
    4. Code change:
        * Depending on the complexity of the change, consider structuring your
          PR message with headlines (### headline) in sections, e.g.:
            * Overview (context and short description of the change)
            * Usage example (cli output)
            * Changes (detailed list of every change made)
            * How to test
        * Add 'Close #nnnn' or 'Fixes #nnnn' at the bottom to automatically
          close issue nnnn as soon as your PR gets merged.

    Please insert your text before the --- line, feel free to delete this big
